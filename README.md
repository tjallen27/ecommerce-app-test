# E-commerce Music App test

The aim of this project is to try and implement some new features and build an app solely with Rails (i.e. Not just an API).

The app is designed to be a simple application in which users can browse a small library of music produced for commerical use, and purchase the music after hearing a short preview of the track.

#### Payment
For this application, I am going to look into both Paypal and Stripe implementation.

When the user clicks "Buy" on the track they would like to purchase, they will be directed to a payment gateway and once the payment has been verified, the full audio file will be downloaded.
