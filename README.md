# E-commerce Music App test

### To run, clone repo, install gems and run gulp.

The aim of this project is to try and implement some new features and build an app solely with Rails (i.e. Not just an API).

The app is designed to be a simple application in which users can browse a small library of music produced for commercial use, and purchase the music after hearing a short preview of the track.

#### Payment
For this application, I am going to look into Stripe implementation.

When the user clicks "Buy" on the track they would like to purchase, they will be directed to a payment gateway and once the payment has been verified, the full audio file will be downloaded.

*The song used is Run by Foo Fighters, which is used to demo the application and not a royalty free download.*
